# Minimal-set-of-variable
This includes an transition file from amplitudes in GGT package to minimal set of variable, and also extraction from amplitude to CEV and PEV. It includes all results for colour ordered PEV from one to 4 emissions and also CEV of 4 emissions.

# Usage
Put "Example_v0" in the **same** extraction directory. So that it can read all the data file ".m". Open it and enjoy.

# Content in the CEV PEV data file
To avoid clustering RAM with irrelevant data, one can load particular PEV or CEV according to table 
"list of result PEV"
"list of result CEV"
